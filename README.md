Functional programming is a programming paradigm used by some languages. However, languages like C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python are not primarily based on functional programming. There are three main 

programming paradigms:

1. Procedural Programming (e.g., C)
2. Object-Oriented Programming (e.g., C#, Java, etc.). C++ and Python support both procedural and object-oriented programming.
3. Functional Programming (e.g., Haskell, Erlang, Elixir, etc.)
Although not all languages are based on the functional programming paradigm, functional concepts can still be utilized to some extent in many languages.

The given code is a clear, brief, and simple example of functional programming concepts. In the example, there are two types of function layers:

Pure Functions, which always produce the same output given the same input.
Higher-Order Functions, which operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
Benefits of Functional Programming:
The benefits are significant. Instead of creating and modifying multiple variables, we call functions that manage their data in the stack during runtime and destroy it upon completion, returning the result. This approach helps avoid mutation and the creation of variables that can lead to bugs, making the code more reusable, modular, generic, and easier to understand.
